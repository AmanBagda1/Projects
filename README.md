# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Movie-Reviews
Sentiment analysis is a sub-domain of artiﬁcial intelligence where the analysis is focused on the extraction of emotions and opinions of the people towards a particular topic from a data. In this project, we try to focus our task of sentiment analysis on IMDB movie review database. We examine the sentiment expression to classify the polarity of the movie review as positive or negative and perform feature extraction and ranking and use these features to train our multi-label classiﬁer to classify the movie review into its correct label. Due to lack of strong grammatical structures in moviereviewswhichfollowtheinformaljargon,anapproachbasedonstructuredNgrams has been followed. In addition, a comparative study on different classiﬁcation approaches has been performed to determine the most suitable classiﬁer to suit our problem domain. Our approach using classiﬁcation techniques has the best accuracy of 83 percent.
